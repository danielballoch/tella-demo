1. setup form and test api w/updating sidebar
2. create reusable input components w/ state

-need to add reusable component to input and get calculation of total income & liabilities working/sending to api
-get main additions working then add on "add x" feature, just need total value back from each component 
//map components? state controlling how many components and map based on that.
*add dashes inbetween sidebar values 
*add per year option to input-component
*add additional income feature to input-component
*hide sidebar values if no data

//keep getting incomeUpdate is not a function which doesn't make a whole lot of sense... becaues it is. Should probably sleep for a couple hours and come back to this. It's probably something dumb. Sleep on it you'll figure it out.

//maybe it's because i'm using the component twice?? so it's there on the first one but not the second
